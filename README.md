For this exercise, please apply the following instructions:

Limit your effort to 3-4 hours max, you do not need to complete the exercise to submit, as we like to get a sense of coding speed based on how far you get.
Develop the page using HTML, vanilla Javascript (or jQuery if necessary), and CSS or SCSS.
Once you have finished, please send back:
A link to the github repository hosting your code
A URL where we can preview the work
Any documentation you want to share about how you built it, work that you weren't able to finish, or anything else you think would help us evaluate the quality of your work and better understand your dev style/approach.
We value communication skills and critical thinking as much as technical output, so our Tech Directors appreciate detailed dev notes on your approach, your thoughts, your questions, and what you would have done with more time.

Thank you in advance for your effort, and good luck!
